THIS PROJECT IS INTENDED FOR THE CLIMATE SCIENCE OLYMPIAD SEMIFINALIST 24' COMPETITION.

MY PARTNER AND I DEVELOPED A PRELIMINARY NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND MACHINE LEARNING (ML) MODEL THAT COULD ACCURATELY PREDICT AND DETERMINE SPECIFC RECCOMENDATIONS FOR USERS
TO PROVE EASE OF USE AND REALISTICNESS OF OUR PROJECT FOR THE PROPOSED PLAN, WE DEVELOPED THIS MODEL WITHOUT INTEGRATING ANY OTHER COMPANY API's (FROM SCRATCH)
